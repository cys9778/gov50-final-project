## Project Thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to financial status and political affiliation. I wish to explore the how individuals of different financial backgrounds, income and savings amounts, tax brackets, etc., vote during federal and state candidate races. Is there a correlation between the two variables? I'm looking forward to diving deeper into the data.
